## Usage

To use PyCodar, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python pycodar.py <directory_path>
```

Replace `<directory_path>` with the path to the directory you want to analyze. PyCodar will generate a summary of your codebase, including the file structure and detailed insights.

- `--color`: Enable colored output for better visibility.
- `--dead-code`: Enable dead code detection.

### Example with Options

```bash
python pycodar.py /path/to/your/python/project --color --dead-code
```

This command will analyze your project with colored output and will also check for dead code.
